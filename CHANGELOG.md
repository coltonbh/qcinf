## [unreleased]

### Added

- Kabsch algorithm for determining the optimal rotation matrix to align two structures and compute an optimally aligned RMSD.
- High-performance Quaternion Characteristic Polynomial (QCP) RMSD/alignment backend as an alternative using a numba-compiled kernel:

  - Implements Theobald’s direct RMSD evaluation and Liu’s adjoint quaternion method for efficient rotation extraction.
  - Provides `qcp_rotation_and_rmsd`, `qcp_rotation`, and `qcp_rmsd` as interfaces to the high performance numba kernel.
  - Achieves ~15x performance improvements over the pure-Python Kabsch implementation while maintaining numerical correctness (the ~15x speedup is basically constant across structure size since the speedup is relative to a constant factor of SVD on a 3x3 matrix).
  - Graceful fallback mechanism:
    - If numba is unavailable or fails to import, the QCP functions automatically fall back to a Kabsch-based implementation with a clear runtime warning.
    - Added optional dependency group `qcinf[fast]` to install numba acceleration.

- New utility functions:

  - `rotation_matrix(axis, angle_deg)` for constructing analytic rotation matrices.
  - `rotate_structure(struct, axis, angle_deg)` for generating rotated structures.

- `determine_connectivity` function that computes `Structure` connectivity using covalent radii and a scaling factor. Bond order is set to 1.0 for all bonds since this routine only infers connectivity.
  ```python
  >>> from qcinf import determine_connectivity, smiles_to_structure
  >>> struct = smiles_to_structure("O")
  >>> determine_connectivity(struct, cov_factor=1.2) # cov_factor is optional and 1.2 by default
  [(0, 1, 1.0), (0, 2, 1.0)]
  ```

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-27

### Added

- `Structure.connectivity` information when creating a `Structure` using `smiles_to_structure`. [#7](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcinf/pull/7)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed

- `RDKit` backend raising `NameError` because `Mol` object was not defined if `rdkit` was not installed. With deferred evaluation it now correctly raises the `ModuleNotFoundError` when top-level functions try to use `rdkit` if it's not installed. [#6](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcinf/pull/6)

### Changed

- 🚨 Dropped python 3.9 support. Minimum supported version is now 3.10.

### Added

- Python 3.10-3.14 test matrix for GitHub Workflows.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-01

### Added

- `filter_conformers_indices` function to better serve the existing requirements of `qcio.view` setup.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-01

### Added

- Setup all DevOps workflows and basic package setup.
- Copied over all cheminformatics functions (e.g., `rmsd`, `align`, `filter_conformers` (formerly `ConformerSearchResults.conformers_filtered()`), `Structure.from_smiles()`, `Structure.to_smiles()`, etc.) from `qcio` into this repo.
