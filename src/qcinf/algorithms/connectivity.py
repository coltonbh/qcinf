    Two atoms are considered bonded when their distance is less than or equal to
    `cov_factor * (r_cov(i) + r_cov(j))`. Bond orders are set to 1.0 since this
    routine only infers connectivity. Numpy vectorization is used for speed (~27x faster
    than nested loops for a 40-atom molecule, 55x faster for a 113-atom molecule).

        indices and a bond order of 1.0.
